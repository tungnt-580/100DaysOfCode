### Day 7: Monday, January 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**:
* Solve 1 FCC challange: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/smallest-common-multiple (It take 1h because the first solution I written failed the last test case but I didn't know why (It return correctly value when I run in Chrome console). After reviewed others's solution (for fun) and came back to my code, I found that may be it run out of time with last test case, then I changed code to better solution and "Tara, passed!").

**Thoughts:**
* I'm so happy I learn to code and do meaningful things every day.
