# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Thursday, January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**:
* Setup 100DaysOfCode projects.
* Write README for this project (it has taken to much time).

**Thoughts:**
* Writing in English have never been easy with me, but it'll be better, through time. I know it!
* Tomorrow, I will really do some coding.
