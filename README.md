# 100 days of code
Really important project for me to keep motivation on the way to be better programmer. Idea from: http://100daysofcode.com

2017 is one of most important years of my life, when I changed my mind-set too much. But with some bad habit, I did many things which are meaningless with my life, and I can't stop hating myself.

I always want to create a habit to force myself improving my programming skills everyday. I've tried to do it by some ways, but with no rules for myself, or keep pulishing it to the world, it'll easy to be dropped after 1 or 2 months.

To make 2018 better, I want to use this project to keep motivate myself, and stop hating myself!

The progress will be pushed to [Log](./log.md) file

This project is started from Wednesday, January 3, 2018.
